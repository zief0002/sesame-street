Statistics is more than just an application of mathematics or a methodology used in some disciplines. Statistics is a principled way of thinking about the world. In particular, it is a principled approach to data collection, prediction, and scientific inference. In today’s dynamic and interdisciplinary world, success in confronting new analytical issues requires both substantial knowledge of a scientific or technological area and highly flexible problem-solving strategies. This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion.\nUpon completion of this course, students should have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation, and inference, as well as an appreciation for the fundamental role that statistics plays in a host of disciplines, such as business, economics, law, and medicine."

    "text": "Course Philosophy and Format of Instruction\nThis is not a class where you only come each day, listen, watch, and take notes! The primary method for learning new statistical concepts and methods will be by reading provided materials before class, participating in class activities and discussions, and working through lab assignments. This course makes extensive use of small group and large group activities and discussions to introduce ideas and understanding of material encountered in the readings. Your learning experience is thus dependent, to some extent, on your classmates and vice versa. Because of this, it is essential that you not only attend class each day and participate in the activities and discussions, but that you show up prepared, having completed the assigned readings. Internalizing a discipline’s way of thinking about and solving problems is a time-consuming process, with the keyword being “process.” It is not something that can be taught to students in a semester, or even year-long, course. Learning statistics takes much more than memorizing formulas or software commands. It requires active participation and questioning both in and out of the classroom. The instructor of this course will provide you with many opportunities to learn the material through class activities, readings, and lab assignments, but in the end, you will have to do all of the hard work of actually learning that material.\n\n\nHow Can I Be Successful in this Course?\nThere are several things you can do to be successful in this course. First and foremost, complete all of the readings and come to class every day. Complete all the out-of-class work. Ask questions. If you are experiencing problems, need help, or have any questions or other course-related concerns, do not hesitate to get in touch with the instructor."

As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another’s individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class.\n\n\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes (SLO’s)\nEPSY 3264 addresses two components of the University of Minnesota’s required learning outcomes.\n\nAfter completing this course, students will know the basic terms, concepts, principles, methods, and perspectives of statistics and will be able to build a framework of knowledge within the major themes of the course (Component 3: Have mastered a body of knowledge and mode of inquiry).\nStudents will also be able to communicate the results of a statistical analysis with others, as well as discuss both ideas and applications of the discipline with peers (Component 5: Can communicate effectively).\n\n\n\n\nLiberal Education\nEPSY 3264 fulfills the Mathematical Thinking component of the Liberal Education requirements at the University of Minnesota. An important part of any liberal education is learning to use abstract thinking and symbolic language to solve practical problems. Understanding quantitative information is fundamental to engaging in our complex world. Business, academia, and even everyday life are filled with the enumeration of information, and all increasingly require data-driven decision-making. In this course, students will be immersed in the fundamental activities of collecting data, producing data, analyzing data, and interpreting summaries and analyses of data. In addition, students will encounter the diversity and cross-disciplinary application of statistics in the real-world through problem contexts, assignments and readings.\n\n\n\n\nStress Management\nStress management is an important piece of the skill set needed for success in college. Pet Away Worry & Stress (PAWS) is one of the many resources available to students. Find out more at https://boynton.umn.edu/paws.\n\nYou can follow Tilly the Therapy Chicken on Twitter (@TherapyChicken)."

It also affects your classmates. Because of the adverse impact missing class may have on your classmates, the instructor reserves the right to re-assign groups on the day of the quiz, or have you work independently. Please be on time. Showing up late to class is not only disruptive, it is disrespectful to your classmates. When you show up late, your group needs to spend valuable time catching you up on what you missed. If you show up late for a group quiz, you may be required to take the quiz by yourself.\nIf you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nEmail your group members so they know you will also be absent.\nComplete the class activity that you missed on your own. (If you want credit for the day’s exit ticket, submit your completed activity to the instructor via email prior to the next class. If you cannot complete the activity prior to the next class, you need to email the instructor prior to that class to receive an extension. Whether you will receive an extension is at the discretion of the instructor.)\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I Zoom students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with your group, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you are absent on the day a quiz or test is due, you must provide documentation explaining your absence for the instructor to determine whether you will be allowed to submit that test later or take a make-up quiz. This will be at the instructor’s discretion and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis (see University Policy). If you miss a group quiz and do not communicate with the instructor, you will receive a 0 on that quiz.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other AI Policy\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, may not be used for answering any of the questions on the individual exams, group quizzes, or exit tickets. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA.\nIf you are caught using AI to answer questions on any of the exams or quizzes, you will be given a 0 on that exam/quiz and a Scholastic Dishonesty Report Form will be filled out and reported to the Office of Community Standards. Depending on the severity of the offense, the instructor also reserves the right to give you an “F” in the course.\n\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or using TinkerPlots will not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy’s limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."

    "text": "Part I: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Runtime\nUse TinkerPlots™ to open the mcu.tp3 file (within TinkerPlots™ select File &gt; Open...). These data include information about Marvel Cinematic Universe Titles (MCU).\n\n\nCreate a Dot plot\n\nCreate a dot plot of the movie runtime (in minutes) by dragging the runtime attribute to the plot’s x-axis.\nFully separate the cases. There shouldn’t be any bin lines in the plot. Remember bin lines are the vertical lines separating the data into bins corresponding to ranges of numbers.\nVertically stack the cases in the plot so they are organized. If your points are floating like the ones in the plot below then it is not vertically stacked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The plot on the left is vertically stacked, but not fully separated. The plot on the right is fully separated, but not vertically stacked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy and paste your final (fully separated and vertically stacked) plot into a word-processed document.\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Your Plot\nNext we will add the average of the to your plot.\n\nHighlight the plot by clicking on it, and select the Averages (Mean) button in the upper toolbar (the triangle). This should add a triangle to your plot underneath the mean value.\nWith the plot still highlighted, choose the Averages Options in the upper toolbar (the upside-down triangle next to Averages) and select Show Numeric Value(s). This should display the numeric value of the mean in the plot.\n\n\nCopy and paste this plot (with the mean and the numeric value of the mean displayed) into your word-processed document.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying cases\n\nIn the plot, click on a case that is near the mean runtime. Identify the MCU title you clicked on and its runtime. Add this to your document.\n\n\n\nThe runtime variable was recorded as a number. This is called quantitative data. When we record variables as a number, our dotplots of that variable will not have any bin lines dividing the data. However, we might collect data that is not a number, but instead is a category. This is called categorical data. For example, season is an example of a categorical variable (recorded as summer/not summer). When we create a dot plot of categorical data, it will have a bin for each category, even when fully separated.\n\n\n\nThere are different storylines, called “phases”, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Create a dot plot of the phase values by dragging the phase attribute to the plot’s x-axis. Separate the values so that the cases are separated into the four phases (there will still be a vertical line separating them). Also vertically stack them so they are organized. Display the counts (Counts N) and percentages (Counts %) for each phase on the existing dot plot. Copy and paste this plot into your word-processed document.\n\n\n\nCall over the instructor or TA to check your work and make sure you are on the right track."

Fully separate the values (no bin lines) and vertically stack them so they are organized.\n\nAdd the format attribute to the y-axis of the plot. This will separate the runtimes for movies and tv shows.\nAdd a divider to the existing dot plot by highlighting the plot and clicking the Divider button in the toolbar. This will divide the plot into three distinct parts: a shaded middle part and two unshaded ends.\nOnce the divider has been added to the plot, display percentages on the plot. Percentages should be displayed for all three parts of the divided plot.\n\n\nMove the endpoints of the divider so that the shaded part covers the area where most of the data points fall for each format. Copy and paste this plot, with the divider and percentages, into your word-processed document.\n\n\n\nUse the endpoints of the divider to complete this statement: Most MCU movies are between ___ and ___ minutes long.\n\n\n\nBased on the plot, comment on potential differences in runtimes between tv shows and movies. How do they compare?\n\n\n\nIdentify the movie that has the longest runtime.\n\n\n\nAdd the mean of the runtimes (triangle) and the numerical value of the mean to the plot. Find the runtime for Ms. Marvel, and add a vertical reference line at that value. Change the position of the vertical reference line by double clicking on the red square at the top of the vertical reference line, and then type in the value where you would like the line to be located. Copy and paste this plot (with the displayed means and the vertical reference line) into your word-processed document.\n\n\n\nBased on the plot, how does the runtime for Ms. Marvel compare with the other TV shows? Explain using evidence from your plot.\n\n\n\nCall over the instructor or TA to check your work for #9 and #10. This is your exit ticket for the day. Also share the word-processed document with all the groups’ members."

    "text": "There are three components that make up your grade: individual exams, group quizzes, and daily exit tickets. You need to complete all of the individual exams and group quizzes to receive a grade in the course. Any student who does not complete all the individual exams and group quizzes without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.\n\n\n\nThere are 5 individual exams, which you will complete outside of class. These are due by 9:45am on their due date (see schedule). Each exam will make up 10% of your grade. They include problems that will help evaluate your understanding of the course material, including use of the TinkerPlots software. Although you will complete the exams outside of class, they are individual in nature. In other words, you need to complete them without help or discussion with any other people.\nIf we have any reason to suspect that a student gave assistance or received assistance from another student or person outside the class, all students involved (including the student(s) who gave assistance) will receive a score of zero on that exam and will be reported to the Office of Community Standards. Depending on the severity of the offense, the instructor also reserves the right to give all students involved an “F” in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 5 group quizzes, which you will complete in class. Each quiz will make up 6% of your grade. They consist of several short answer questions designed to test your ability to apply the knowledge you gained by reading the assigned material, working on assignments, and participating in class activities and discussions. You will also be expected to use TinkerPlots on the group quizzes. It is expected that you will work cooperatively with your group members to decide on the answers to the questions posed in the group quiz. Only one quiz per group will be graded, and each student in the group will receive the same grade.\nIf you arrive late for a quiz, or have missed previous class periods, you may be required to take the quiz by yourself. The instructor also reserves the right to re-assign groups on the day of the quiz.\n\n\n\n\nExit tickets will be given in each class session. The exit tickets will make up 20% of your grade. The “ticket” consists of a single question designed to assess your knowledge about, or have you reflect on the day’s class content. These questions are to be completed individually. The exit tickets are not marked right/wrong, but are based on whether or not you complete the ticket.\nIf you miss class for a University approved reason (see Policy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work), you can make-up the exit ticket for that day by submitting the completed class activity for the day you missed. This will need to be submitted by the next class period unless you have previously made arrangements with the instructor. If you cannot complete the activity prior to the next class, you need to email the instructor prior to that class to receive an extension. Whether you will receive an extension is at the discretion of the instructor.\n\n\n\n\nEngaging in active class participation is an important part of taking ownership of your learning. Active participation is more than just showing up for class. It also includes being engaged during the class, asking questions (if you have a question, it is likely that others do as well), providing additional insight and material, responding to other students and the instructor, and always being open and inquisitive. Although we do not grade your participation, it is expected you will engage with your group and other classmates.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no extra credit in this course."

    "text": "FAQs\nHow do I submit the individual exams?\nCreate a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\nYour name is on the exam.\nYou have answered every part of every question.\nAll figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\n\nDo I need to turn in the TinkerPlots file?\nNo…unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the TinkerPlots file; the TinkerPlots file is for your reference. However, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your TinkerPlots file after you submit the exam to help us interpret mistakes you made on the exam so that we can provide more thorough feedback.\nWill you provide answer keys to the individual exams or group quizzes?\nNo. You will get back several comments on these assessments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you go over the answers in class?\nNo. I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assessments more in depth is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn’t, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you look at our individual exams prior to us submitting it?\nThe instructor or TA will not “pre-grade” your individual exams. Nor will we tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can, howver, answer clarifying questions (e.g., ‘I know Question 8 is asking about […], but I’m not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?’). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! 😄 If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general ‘did I do this right’!\nWill we be able to re-do the individual exams or group quizzes?\nNo. The individual exams mimic the content you learn in class via the activities. You should perform well on these so long as you come to class and participate. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the group quizzes, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission."
